Our project attempts to address the issue of missing children, specifically Amber Alerts and related scenarios. We wish to compile useful resources in the situation that a child goes missing. We reviewed several websites and other pre-existing resources for amber alerts, but found them to be either poorly designed or lacking appropriate information to help address the situation.
